# Sophie Chance's Personal Website

## Overview

Welcome to the source code of my personal website. Here, I have endeavored to bridge the gap between the polished, resume-version of myself and the genuine passions and experiences that define me. Through this platform, I aim to share my love for my work and offer an intimate insight into who I truly am.
